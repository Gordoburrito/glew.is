#The Challenge
Awareness in Bloom will serve as a landing space to give more information about Pam’s coaching business and her services. Other functions of the site will give prospective clients the opportunity to contact Pam. Also provide legitimacy to the business through the website. (Future phases of this project may go to supporting an online relationship with customers, such as a newsletter, blog, and a way to schedule appointments.)

“Thanks to Gordon, I love my website! Although I didn’t know Gordon before we started working together, I knew right away that he was committed to giving me a quality website that not only functioned well but looked great and met my current business needs. I was pleasantly surprised by the types of specific questions Gordon asked in his intake process, and how important it was to him to understand what I wanted, both in my website and from my website. Gordon was humbly willing to explain the parts of his process that I didn’t understand, and was patient with my anxiety and indecisive moments. Within 2 weeks he took my jumbled web copy and broken ideas and made something I am proud of. I look forward to when I can hire Gordon again to upgrade my website, and I definitely recommend Gordon as a web designer!”
